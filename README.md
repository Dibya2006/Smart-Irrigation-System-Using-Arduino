# Smart-Irrigation-System-Using-Arduino
This project automates plant watering using a soil moisture sensor and Arduino. When the soil is dry, the Arduino activates a motor (water pump) via a relay spdt to irrigate the plants. Once adequate moisture is detected, the motor turns off. The system helps conserve water and reduce manual effort.
